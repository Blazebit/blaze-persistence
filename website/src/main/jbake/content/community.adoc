Contribute code::
Before you can contribute code, you should setup you environment for developing Blaze-Persistence!

==== Quick setup

Since we are working on GitHub you should start by forking Blaze-Persistence and cloning that repository.

[source,bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/blaze-persistence
cd blaze-persistence
----

Blaze-Persistence uses https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven, window="_blank"] so make sure you have a current version installed. You can build the project with the default profiles

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean package
----

Development should be possible with any IDE but is probably easiest with https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ, window="_blank"] since the Core team also uses that.
