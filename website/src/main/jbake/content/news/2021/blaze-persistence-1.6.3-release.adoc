We are happy to announce the third bug fix release of the 1.6 series. This release again contains not only bug fixes, but also some new features that I would like to highlight.

Yet again, thanks to the extensive testing of https://github.com/EugenMayer[Eugen Mayer, window="_blank"] from https://kontextwork.de/[KontextWork, window="_blank"] we polished the GraphQL integration even further.
The integration now supports inferring nullability of entity view attributes for the generated GraphQL schema based on the mapping expression.
On top of that, he also helped us fix an issue with the "single valued association id access optimization" for non primary key based foreign keys, which now also avoids producing a join.

We fixed a few bugs and lifted certain limitations for entity views:

* Fix pagination issues when `JOIN` fetching for a collection and `SUBSELECT` fetching was used
* Support `SUBSELECT` fetching when main query builder uses `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` and/or `ORDER BY` clauses
* Validate more uses of `MULTISET` fetching for proper type support to avoid runtime errors
* Validate mapping index expressions properly regarding their typing
* Fix issues with setter determination in entity views when same named methods with different arguments exist
* Fix concurrency issue in entity view annotation processor leading to strange errors

Thanks to our awesome community we fixed:

* JPA Criteria bug regarding joins over embeddables and parameter handling issues
* Fix compatibility with Quarkus 2.1+ by registering `ValuesEntity` in deployment integration
* Fix base URI determination in Spring HATEOAS integration to be compatible with Spring HATEOAS 1.3.4
* Fix parsing of `LIKE` predicate with parameter in `ESCAPE`
* Fix literal parsing issues with a single backslash to match the requirements of the JPA spec
* Fix rendering of literals in JPA Criteria and introduce configuration option to control value rendering
* Make sure `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` is respected when generating a count query

The changes we had to do to in the string literal parsing and rendering to match the expectation of the JPA spec unvealed a non-standard compliant behavior of PostgreSQL,
which uses a backslash as default escape character in a `LIKE` predicate when no escape character is given.
We automatically escape the `LIKE` pattern now to guarantee the same behavior across databases, but this escaping might lead to double escaping if you already did escaping for PostgreSQL.

Make sure to remove your escaping i.e. `replace("\\", "\\\\")` from your code when updating to Blaze-Persistence 1.6.3.

Another thing to watch out in this release is the stricter type validation in entity views. Previously we didn't properly type validate all mapping expressions,
which could have lead to some runtime exceptions. Now that we do type validation, you might see startup failures though due to unsafe expressions.
A prime example of a possible issue is the comparison of an enum attribute with a string or integer i.e. the SQL representation.
A expression like `case when type = 'KEY' then ...` should be replaced with `case when type = package.MyEnum.KEY then ...` so that the comparison has matching types.

Take a look into the https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#163[changelog, window="_blank"] for a full list of changes and improvements.

Enjoy the release and stay tuned for the next one!
