Blaze-Persistence version 1.3.0-Alpha3 adds many new features and fixes quite a few issues!

Originally, we didn't even plan to push out another Alpha release, but we added so many new features and fixed quite a few annoying bugs, that we decided to push out another version instead of letting you wait for the final release.

Unfortunately we had to do some backwards-incompatible changes to the jpa-criteria module as we wrongly made JPA `CriteriaQuery` dependent on an `EntityManager` which prevented caching. The only difference is that the `EntityManager` will now have to be passed to a `createCriteriaBuilder` method that was added to the JPA extension interface `BlazeCriteriaQuery` instead of passing it during query creation via the `BlazeCriteria` utility class.

To support varying page sizes and thus also offsets that aren't calculatable based on the `page` and `pageSize`, we introduced new constructors for `KeysetPageRequest` and changed the semantics of existing ones in the Spring Data and DeltaSpike Data modules. If you constructed `KeysetPageRequest` manually, please review if the constructor that you use fits your needs. Since the DeltaSpike Data integration brings it's own `PageRequest` API, you are also affected of this change when you construct a `PageRequest` with the DeltaSpike Data integration.

The most notable features and bug fixes are:

A big thank you is going out to https://github.com/heruan[Giovanni Lovato, window="_blank"] for pushing forward the Spring Data integration, testing edge cases with embeddables and improving the Eclipse development experience.
Thanks to https://github.com/JWGmeligMeyling[Jan-Willem Gmelig Meyling, window="_blank"] we now also have an integration for the upcoming Hibernate 5.4 release!

The last few issues that are planned for the final 1.3.0 release still need some work. We are currently planning to finish everything up by the end of September.
