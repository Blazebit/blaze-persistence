We just released Blaze-Persistence version 1.4.0-Alpha2, this time, mostly with new features!
The most exciting feature of this release is obviously window function support and the new expression syntax support for it.

If you want to get the number of objects while fetching them and avoid the need for grouping or subqueries, you can now do something like

[source,java]
----
criteriaBuilder.select("count(*) over (partition by entity.id)")
----

We added support for the most common window functions, also see +++<!-- PREVIEW-SUFFIX --><!-- </p></div> --><!-- PREVIEW-END -->+++the new window function chapter: https://persistence.blazebit.com/documentation/core/manual/en_US/index.html#window-functions-2

Other new notable features are:

* https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/issues/812[*#812*, window="_blank"] Temporal extraction, diff, truncation and arithmetic functions
* https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/issues/803[*#803*, window="_blank"] Introduction of comparison methods that render literals
* https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/issues/801[*#801*, window="_blank"] MySQL 8 support
* https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/issues/797[*#797*, window="_blank"] EntityManager resolving in spring data integration is random
* https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/issues/795[*#795*, window="_blank"] Move available configuration properties to API artifacts
* https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/issues/793[*#793*, window="_blank"] Shade ANTLR into parser

Take a look into the https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#140-alpha2[changelog, window="_blank"] for a full list of changes and improvements.

A big thank you goes out to Jan-Willem Gmelig Meyling and his colleague Sayra Ranjha for implementing the initial window functions as well as the temporal functions!

The long awaited feature entity view lifecycle listeners will take some more time as I'm currently working on a new project called https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-notify[blaze-notify, window="_blank"]
that will make it super easy to integrate transactional notifications(E-Mail, App notifications, etc.) into your own applications.

Unless someone works on a PR for other new features, the next release will be about preliminary support for entity view lifecycle listeners!
