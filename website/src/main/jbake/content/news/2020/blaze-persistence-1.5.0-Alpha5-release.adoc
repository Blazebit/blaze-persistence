We recently switched from using JDK 9 to JDK 14 for our releases and accidentally compiled MR-JAR contents with the Java 14 classfile version.
This release fixes that, so that you can run Blaze-Persistence again with all Java versions from 9 to 13.
We also fixed a query plan caching bug for DML queries that are using the `RETURNING` clause along with
+++<!-- PREVIEW-SUFFIX --><!-- </p></div> --><!-- PREVIEW-END -->+++other advanced features like CTEs.

If you want to know more about the new features or bug fixes, take a look into the https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#150-alpha5[changelog, window="_blank"] for a full list of changes and improvements.

We cut down the plan for the final 1.5 release down to the bare minimum. We will deliver further improvements through bug-fix releases.
