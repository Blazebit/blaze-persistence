== Configuration

{projectname} can be configured by setting properties on a link:{core_jdoc}/persistence/spi/CriteriaBuilderConfiguration.html#setProperty(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String)[`CriteriaBuilderConfiguration`]
object and creating a link:{core_jdoc}/persistence/spi/CriteriaBuilderConfiguration.html#createCriteriaBuilderFactory(javax.persistence.EntityManagerFactory)[`CriteriaBuilderFactory`] from it.

You can also set configuration properties on a per builder basis via the link:{core_jdoc}/persistence/CommonQueryBuilder.html#setProperty(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String)[`setProperty(String, String)`] method.

=== Configuration properties

==== COMPATIBLE_MODE

Enables JPA compatibility mode to disallow the usage of vendor specific extensions. This will result in higher portability.

[width="100%",cols="2,10",options="header,footer"]
|====================
| Key | com.blazebit.persistence.compatible_mode 
| Type | boolean 
| Default | false
| Applicable | Configuration only
|====================

==== RETURNING_CLAUSE_CASE_SENSITIVE

Defines whether column names should be used with the case in which they are given or as lower case when returning column values from a DML query.
This is mostly relevant for PostgreSQL which requires `false` to work properly.

[width="100%",cols="2,10",options="header,footer"]
|====================
| Key | com.blazebit.persistence.returning_clause_case_sensitive
| Type | boolean 
| Default | true
| Applicable | Always
|====================

==== SIZE_TO_COUNT_TRANSFORMATION

Defines whether the SIZE to COUNT tranformation should be applied to queries or not.
The transformation can be very beneficial especially for databases that can't optimize subqueries properly within the context of a parent query.
This property exists just so you can turn the transformation off if you encounter problems.

[width="100%",cols="2,10",options="header,footer"]
|====================
| Key | com.blazebit.persistence.size_to_count_transformation
| Type | boolean 
| Default | true
| Applicable | Always
|====================

==== IMPLICIT_GROUP_BY_FROM_SELECT

Defines whether non-aggregate expressions from the SELECT clause should be automatically added to the GROUP BY.
Some databases require that all non-aggregate expressions must be included in the GROUP BY clause which is pretty annoying.
This feature can make writing queries a lot easier since it will implicitly copy expressions over to the GROUP BY clause.

[width="100%",cols="2,10",options="header,footer"]
|====================
| Key | com.blazebit.persistence.implicit_group_by_from_select
| Type | boolean 
| Default | true
| Applicable | Always
|====================

==== IMPLICIT_GROUP_BY_FROM_HAVING

Defines whether non-aggregate expressions from the HAVING clause should be automatically added to the GROUP BY.
Some databases require that all non-aggregate expressions must be included in the GROUP BY clause which is pretty annoying.
This feature can make writing queries a lot easier since it will implicitly copy expressions over to the GROUP BY clause.

[width="100%",cols="2,10",options="header,footer"]
|====================
| Key | com.blazebit.persistence.implicit_group_by_from_having
| Type | boolean 
| Default | true
| Applicable | Always
|====================

==== IMPLICIT_GROUP_BY_FROM_ORDER_BY

Defines whether non-aggregate expressions from the ORDER BY clause should be automatically added to the GROUP BY.
Some databases require that all non-aggregate expressions must be included in the GROUP BY clause which is pretty annoying.
This feature can make writing queries a lot easier since it will implicitly copy expressions over to the GROUP BY clause.

[width="100%",cols="2,10",options="header,footer"]
|====================
| Key | com.blazebit.persistence.implicit_group_by_from_order_by
| Type | boolean 
| Default | true
| Applicable | Always
|====================

==== EXPRESSION_OPTIMIZATION

Defines whether expressions should be optimized.

[width="100%",cols="2,10",options="header,footer"]
|====================
| Key | com.blazebit.persistence.expression_optimization
| Type | boolean 
| Default | true
| Applicable | Configuration only
|====================

==== EXPRESSION_CACHE_CLASS

The full qualified expression cache implementation class name.

[width="100%",cols="2,10",options="header,footer"]
|====================
| Key | com.blazebit.persistence.expression.cache_class
| Type | String 
| Default | com.blazebit.persistence.impl.expression.ConcurrentHashMapExpressionCache
| Applicable | Configuration only
|====================

==== VALUES_CLAUSE_FILTER_NULLS

Defines whether tuples of a VALUES clause with all NULL values should be filtered out.
The property can be changed for a criteria builder before using the VALUES clause.

[width="100%",cols="2,10",options="header,footer"]
|====================
| Key | com.blazebit.persistence.values.filter_nulls
| Type | boolean
| Default | true
| Applicable | Always
|====================

==== PARAMETER_AS_LITERAL_RENDERING

Defines whether parameters should be rendered as literals when the type can not be inferred, or always as parameter.
The property can be changed for a criteria builder before constructing a query.

[width="100%",cols="2,10",options="header,footer"]
|====================
| Key | com.blazebit.persistence.parameter_literal_rendering
| Type | boolean
| Default | true
| Applicable | Always
|====================

==== OPTIMIZED_KEYSET_PREDICATE_RENDERING

Defines whether the keyset predicate should be rendered in an optimized form so that database optimizers are more likely
to use indices.
The property can be changed for a criteria builder before constructing a query.

[width="100%",cols="2,10",options="header,footer"]
|====================
| Key | com.blazebit.persistence.optimized_keyset_predicate_rendering
| Type | boolean
| Default | true
| Applicable | Always
|====================

[[configuration-jpql-functions]]
=== Jpql functions

Custom functions that can be invoked via the JPA 2.1 function syntax `FUNCTION('function_name', args...)` can be registered with `registerFunction(JpqlFunctionGroup)`.
A `JpqlFunctionGroup` represents a logical function that can contain multiple implementations for various dbms and can be defined as being an aggregate function.

These functions are registered as native persistence provider functions and can therefore also be used with plain JPA APIs or the native persistence provider APIs.
For more information refer to the <<JPQL functions>> section.

[[configuration-dbms-dialects]]
=== Dbms dialects

Dbms dialect implementations provide SQL-level abstractions for a specific dbms. {projectname} comes with support for the following dbms:

* h2
* mysql
* postgresql
* db2
* oracle
* microsoft

By registering a custom implementation for a specific dbms via `registerDialect(String, DbmsDialect)` the default implementation will be overridden.
For more information refer to the <<Customize DBMS dialect>> section.

[[configuration-entity-manager-factory-integrators]]
=== Entity manager factory integrators

A little integration layer to extract the dbms of an entity manager and register `JpqlFunctionGroup` instances with the entity manager. This is normally provided by an integration module for persistence providers.
