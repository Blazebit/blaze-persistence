== Where clause

The `WHERE` clause has mostly been described already in the <<predicate-builder,Predicate Builder>> chapter.
The clause is applicable to all statement types, but <<implicit-joins,implicit joins>> are only possible in `SELECT` statements,
therefore it is advised to move relation access to an exists subquery in DML statements like

[source,java]
----
CriteriaBuilder<Integer> cb = cbf.update(em, Cat.class, "c")
    .setExpression("age", "age + 1")
    .whereExists()
        .from(Cat.class, "subCat")
        .where("subCat.id").eqExpression("c.id")
        .where("subCat.father.name").like().value("Bill%").noEscape()
    .end();
----

Which will roughly render to the following JPQL

[source,sql]
----
UPDATE Cat c
SET c.age = c.age + 1
WHERE EXISTS(
    SELECT 1
    FROM Cat subCat
    LEFT JOIN subCat.father father_1
    WHERE subCat.id = c.id
      AND father_1.name LIKE :param_1
)
----

=== Keyset pagination support

Keyset pagination or scrolling/filtering is way to efficiently paginate or scroll through a large data set.
The idea of a keyset is, that every tuple can be uniquely identified by that keyset. Pagination only makes sense when the tuples in a data set are ordered
and keyset pagination in contrast to offset pagination makes efficient use of the ordering property of the data set.
By remembering the highest and lowest keysets of a page, it is possible to query the previous and next pages efficiently.

Apart from the <<keyset-pagination,transparent keyset pagination support>>, it is also possible to implement keyset scrolling/filtering manually.
A keyset consists of the values of the `ORDER BY` expressions of a tuple and the last expression must uniquely identify a tuple.
The id of an entity is not only a good candidate in general for the last expression, but also currently the only possible expression to satisfy this constraint.

The following query will order cats by their birthday and second by their id.

[source,java]
----
CriteriaBuilder<Cat> cb = cbf.create(em, Cat.class, "cat")
    .orderByAsc("cat.birthday")
    .orderByAsc("cat.id")
----

[source,sql]
----
SELECT cat FROM Cat cat
ORDER BY cat.birthday ASC, cat.id ASC
----

==== Positional keyset pagination

In order to receive only the first 10 cats you would do

[source,java]
----
List<Cat> cats = cb.setMaxResults(10)
    .getResultList();
----

In order to receive the next cats after the last seen cat (highest keyset) with positional keyset elements you would do

[source,java]
----
Cat lastCat = cats.get(cats.size() - 1);
List<Cat> nextCats = cb.afterKeyset(lastCat.getBirthday(), lastCat.getId())
    .getResultList();
----

which roughly translates to the following JPQL

[source,sql]
----
SELECT cat FROM Cat cat
WHERE cat.birthday > :_keysetParameter_0 OR (
    cat.birthday = :_keysetParameter_0 AND
    cat.id > :_keysetParameter_1
)
ORDER BY cat.birthday ASC NULLS LAST, cat.id ASC NULLS LAST
----

The positional part roughly means that the keyset element as passed into link:{core_jdoc}/persistence/KeysetQueryBuilder.html#afterKeyset(java.io.Serializable...)[afterKeyset()]
or link:{core_jdoc}/persistence/KeysetQueryBuilder.html#beforeKeyset(java.io.Serializable...)[beforeKeyset()] must match the order of the corresponding `ORDER BY` expressions.

Note that this is in general much more efficient than an `OFFSET` based paging/scrolling because this approach can _scroll_ to the next and previous page in `O(log n)`,
whereas using `OFFSET` results in a complexity of `O(n)`, thus making it harder to get to latter pages in big data sets.
This is due to how a keyset paginated query can efficiently traverse an index on the DBMS side. Using `OFFSET` paging requires actually counting tuples that should be skipped which is less efficient.

Similarly to scrolling to a page that comes link:{core_jdoc}/persistence/KeysetQueryBuilder.html#afterKeyset(java.io.Serializable...)[after a keyset],
it is also possible to scroll to a page that comes link:{core_jdoc}/persistence/KeysetQueryBuilder.html#beforeKeyset(java.io.Serializable...)[before a keyset]

[source,java]
----
Cat firstCat = nextCats.get(0);
List<Cat> previousCats = cb.beforeKeyset(firstCat.getBirthday(), firstCat.getId())
    .getResultList();
// cats and previousCats are equal
----

but this time the JPQL looks differently

[source,sql]
----
SELECT cat FROM Cat cat
WHERE cat.birthday < :_keysetParameter_0 OR (
    cat.birthday = :_keysetParameter_0 AND
    cat.id < :_keysetParameter_1
)
ORDER BY cat.birthday DESC NULLS FIRST, cat.id DESC NULLS FIRST
----

This is how keyset pagination works, but still, the DBMS can use the same index as before. This time, it just traverses it backwards!

==== Expression based keyset pagination

This is just like <<positional-keyset-pagination,positional keyset pagination>> but instead of relying on the order of keyset elements and `ORDER BY` expressions,
this makes use of the link:{core_jdoc}/persistence/KeysetBuilder.html[`KeysetBuilder`] which matches by the expression.

[source,java]
----
Cat firstCat = nextCats.get(0);
List<Cat> previousCats = cb.beforeKeyset()
        .with("cat.birthday", firstCat.getBirthday())
        .with("cat.id", firstCat.getId())
    .end()
    .getResultList();
// cats and previousCats are equal
----

This results in the same JPQL as seen above. It's a matter of taste which style to choose.

==== Keyset page based keyset pagination

When using the <<keyset-pagination,transparent keyset pagination support>> through the link:{core_jdoc}/persistence/FullQueryBuilder.html#page(int,%20int)[`PaginatedQueryBuilder`] API
with link:{core_jdoc}/persistence/PaginatedCriteriaBuilder.html#withKeysetExtraction(boolean)[keyset extraction] it is possible to get access to an extracted
link:{core_jdoc}/persistence/PagedList.html#getKeysetPage()[`KeysetPage`] and thus also to the link:{core_jdoc}/persistence/KeysetPage.html#getHighest()[highest]
and link:{core_jdoc}/persistence/KeysetPage.html#getLowest()[lowest] keysets.

These keysets can also be used for paging/scrolling although when already having access to a link:{core_jdoc}/persistence/KeysetPage.html[`KeysetPage`] it might be better to use the
link:{core_jdoc}/persistence/PaginatedQueryBuilder.html[`PaginatedQueryBuilder`] API instead.
