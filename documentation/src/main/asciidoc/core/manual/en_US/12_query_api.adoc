== Query API

The central element to the construction of criteria or query builders is the link:{core_jdoc}/persistence/CriteriaBuilderFactory.html[`CriteriaBuilderFactory`].
The factory provides methods for constructing <<DML statements>>, <<set-operations,left nested set operations>> and
link:{core_jdoc}/persistence/CriteriaBuilderFactory.html#create(javax.persistence.EntityManager,%20java.lang.Class)[`CriteriaBuilder`] instances for `SELECT` statements.

The top level query builders allow access to the query string and also to construct JPA `javax.persistence.Query` or `javax.persistence.TypedQuery` instances through the interfaces

* link:{core_jdoc}/persistence/Queryable.html[`Queryable`]
* link:{core_jdoc}/persistence/Executable.html[`Executable`]
* link:{core_jdoc}/persistence/ModificationCriteriaBuilder.html[`ModificationCriteriaBuilder`]

[.Access generated query string]
[source,java]
----
String queryString = cbf.create(em, Cat.class, "cat")
    .getQueryString();
TypedQuery<Cat> query = em.createQuery(queryString, Cat.class);
----

The possibility to access the query string is a convenience for debugging or monitoring, but queries should always be constructed via the respective query construction methods.
If advanced features like CTEs, Set-Operations or others are used, the query string returned really is just a _logical representation_ of the query structure,
so don't rely on the query string being compilable through `EntityManager#createQuery()`.

WARNING: The constructed JPA query instances for queries that use some of the advanced features currently do not support query hints or unwrapping.

[.Create JPA query]
[source,java]
----
TypedQuery<Cat> query = cbf.create(em, Cat.class, "cat")
    .getTypedQuery();
----

Queries should always be created that way and also can be reused for the transaction just like any other query.

{projectname} also offers convenience methods on the top level query builder interfaces to execute the queries

* link:{core_jdoc}/persistence/Queryable.html#getSingleResult()[`getSingleResult()`] is equivalent to `getTypedQuery().getSingleResult()`
* link:{core_jdoc}/persistence/Queryable.html#getResultList()[`getResultList()`] is equivalent to `getTypedQuery().getResultList()`
* link:{core_jdoc}/persistence/Executable.html#executeUpdate()[`executeUpdate()`] is equivalent to `getQuery().executeUpdate()`

[.Execute a query]
[source,java]
----
List<Cat> query = cbf.create(em, Cat.class, "cat")
    .getResultList();
----

=== Parameter binding

Apart from support for binding parameters on the constructed JPA query, {projectname} also allows to bind parameters on the query builder itself.
All query builders(including subquery and other builders) support setting parameters through the same link:{core_jdoc}/persistence/ParameterHolder.html#setParameter(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.Object)[`setParameter()`] API that is offered by the JPA query API.
In addition to that, it is also possible to inspect the parameters and the bound values while building through link:{core_jdoc}/persistence/ParameterHolder.html#getParameters()[`getParameters()`].

[.Bind parameter on criteria builder]
[source,java]
----
List<Cat> query = cbf.create(em, Cat.class, "cat")
    .where("name").eqExpression(":nameParam")
    .setParameter("nameParam", "Billy")
    .getResultList();
----

WARNING: Beware that positional parameters are not supported!

=== Query properties

As mentioned in the <<configuration,configuration chapter>>, a query builder can be further configured via the link:{core_jdoc}/persistence/CommonQueryBuilder.html#setProperty(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String)[`setProperty(String, String)`] method.
This allows for disabling optimizations when encountering bugs or fine tuning on a case by case basis.

If you encounter, that you make use of a configuration very often, you should consider configuring the property globally via the link:{core_jdoc}/persistence/spi/CriteriaBuilderConfiguration.html[`CriteriaBuilderConfiguration`]
and only switch to a different value when needed.

=== Limitations

Although we try to adopt or at least allow the use of JPA provider extension there are some limitations to the query API that are known and currently not addressed.

* No support for iterative result processing i.e. _scrolling_ yet. See https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/issues/254[#254]
* No support for passing query hints
* No way for query caching for static queries that use advanced features. This is going to be addressed as part of https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/issues/252[#252]
