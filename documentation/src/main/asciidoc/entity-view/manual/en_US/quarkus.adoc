== Quarkus integration

We provide a basic Quarkus extension that allows to use {projectname} core and entity views in a Quarkus application.

[[quarkus-setup]]
=== Setup

To use the Quarkus extension you need to add the following Maven dependency to your Quarkus project:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.blazebit</groupId>
    <artifactId>blaze-persistence-integration-quarkus</artifactId>
    <version>${blaze-persistence.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

[[quarkus-features]]
=== Features

The extension enables entity view scanning at deployment time while the remainder of the bootstrapping is performed
at runtime. It also includes default CDI producers for the link:{core_jdoc}/persistence/CriteriaBuilderFactory.html[`CriteriaBuilderFactory`]
and link:{entity_view_jdoc}/persistence/view/EntityViewManager.html[`EntityViewManager`] that can be overridden as documented
in the Quarkus user guide.
