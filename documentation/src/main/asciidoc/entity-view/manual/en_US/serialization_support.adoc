== Serialization integration

In general, serialization of entity views should be no problem for most serialization frameworks as they rely on getter based access
and entity views naturally define their state through getters.

The deserialization support is a different thing though for which special integrations are required.

By default, the deserialization will invoke `EntityViewManager.getReference(viewType, id)` to construct objects.
If the view type that should be deserialized is creatable i.e. annotated with `@CreatableEntityView` and no value for the `@IdMapping` attribute is provided in the payload,
it will be created via `EntityViewManager.create()`.
The rest of the payload values are then deserialized onto the constructed object via the setters the entity view types provide.

Read-only types only support deserialization when a value for the `@IdMapping` attribute is given and obviously need setters for the deserialization to work properly.
Adding setters makes the models mutable which might not be desirable, so consider this when wanting to deserialize payload to entity views.
A possible solution is to create an entity view subtype that has the sole purpose of providing setters so that it can be deserialized.

Since entity view objects are created via `EntityViewManager.getReference()` or `EntityViewManager.create()`, the objects can then be directly saved via `EntityViewManager.save()`.
For updatable entity views it is important to understand that `EntityViewManager.save()` will only flush non-null attributes i.e. do a partial flush.
This is due to dirty tracking thinking that the initial state is all null attributes. Through deserialization, some attributes are set to values which are then considered dirty.
That behavior is exactly what you would expect from an HTTP endpoint using the `PATCH` method.

If you need to flush the full state regardless of the dirty tracking information, you can use `EntityViewManager.saveFull()`,
but be aware that orphan removals will currently not work when using the `QUERY` flush strategy because the initial state is unknown.
If you need orphan removal in such a case, you are advised to switch to the `ENTITY` flush strategy for now.
You could also make use of the `EntityViewManager.saveTo()` and `EntityViewManager.saveFullTo()` variants to flush data to an entity that was loaded via e.g. `EntityManager.find()`.

An alternative to this would be to deserialize the state onto an existing updatable entity view that was loaded via e.g. `EntityViewManager.find()`.
With the initial state being known due to loading from the database, orphan removal will work correctly,
but be aware that providing `null` values for attributes in the JSON payload will obviously cause `null` to be set on the entity view attributes.

[[jackson-integration]]
=== Jackson integration

[[jackson-setup]]
==== Setup

To use the Jackson integration directly you need the following Maven dependencies:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.blazebit</groupId>
    <artifactId>blaze-persistence-integration-jackson</artifactId>
    <version>${blaze-persistence.version}</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
----

or if you are using Jakarta JPA

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.blazebit</groupId>
    <artifactId>blaze-persistence-integration-jackson-jakarta</artifactId>
    <version>${blaze-persistence.version}</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
----

If you are using JAX-RS, Spring WebMvc or Spring WebFlux, consider using the already existing integrations instead to avoid unnecessary work.

==== Usage

The integration happens by adding a module and a custom visibility checker to an existing `ObjectMapper`.

[source,java]
----
ObjectMapper existingMapper = ...
EntityViewManager evm = ...
EntityViewAwareObjectMapper mapper = new EntityViewAwareObjectMapper(evm, existingMapper);
----

The `EntityViewAwareObjectMapper` class provides utility methods for integrating with JAX-RS, Spring WebMvc and Spring WebFlux,
but you can use your `ObjectMapper` directly as before as the module and visibility checker is registered in the existing mapper.

[[jsonb-integration]]
=== JSONB integration

[[jsonb-setup]]
==== Setup

To use the JSONB integration directly you need the following Maven dependencies:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.blazebit</groupId>
    <artifactId>blaze-persistence-integration-jsonb</artifactId>
    <version>${blaze-persistence.version}</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
----

or if you are using Jakarta JPA

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.blazebit</groupId>
    <artifactId>blaze-persistence-integration-jsonb-jakarta</artifactId>
    <version>${blaze-persistence.version}</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
----

If you are using JAX-RS, Spring WebMvc or Spring WebFlux, consider using the already existing integrations instead to avoid unnecessary work.

==== Usage

The integration happens by adding custom `JsonDeserializer` instances per entity view and a `PropertyVisibilityStrategy` to a `JsonbConfig`.

[source,java]
----
JsonbConfig jsonbConfig = new JsonbConfig();
EntityViewJsonbDeserializer.integrate(jsonbConfig, evm, idValueAccessor);
Jsonb jsonb = JsonbBuilder.create(jsonbConfig);
----

The resulting `Jsonb` instance will make use of the special deserializers for entity views and you can simply use it as usual e.g. `jsonb.fromString("...", MyEntityView.class)`.
