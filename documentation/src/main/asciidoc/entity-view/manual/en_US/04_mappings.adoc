== Mappings

As already mentioned in the <<Getting started>> section, the entity view module builds up on the core module.
Some of the basics like link:{core_doc}#implicit-joins[implicit joins]
and the basic link:{core_doc}#expressions[expression structure] should be known to understand all of the following mapping examples.

Entity views are to entities in ORM, what table views are to tables in an RDBMS. They represent projections on the entity model.
In a sense you can say that entity views are DTOs 2.0 or DTOs done right.

One of the unique features of entity views is that it *only* imposes a structure and the projections, but the base query defines the data source.
{projectname} tried to reduce as much of the boilerplate as possible for defining the structure and the projections by employing a convention over configuration approach.

The result of these efforts is that entity views are defined as interfaces or abstract classes mostly containing just getter definitions that serve as attribute definitions.
To declare that an interface or an abstract class as entity view, you have to annotate it and specify the entity class for which this entity view provides projections.

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
interface CatView { ... }
----

So an entity view can be seen as a named wrapper for a bunch of attributes, where every attribute has some kind of mapping that is based on the attributes the entity type offers.
An attribute is declared by defining an abstract method in an entity view i.e. every non-abstract method is considered being an attribute.

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
interface CatView {
    @IdMapping("id")
    Long getId();

    String getName();
}
----

Since every method of an interface is abstract, you can omit the `abstract` keyword.
In this simple example you can see that the `CatView` has an attribute named `name`. The implicit mapping for the attribute is the attribute name itself, so `name`.
This means that the entity view attribute `name` declared by the abstract method `getName()` is mapped to the entity attribute `name`.

NOTE: Since entity views and their mappings are validated during startup against the entity model, you should see any mapping related runtime errors and can be sure it works if it doesn't fail to start

One of the nice things about using interfaces is that you can have multiple inheritance. If you separate concerns in separate _feature interfaces_,
you can effectively make use of multiple inheritance.

[source,java]
----
interface NameView {
    String getName();
}

interface AgeView {
    Long getAge();
}

@EntityView(Cat.class)
interface CatView extends NameView, AgeView {
    @IdMapping("id")
    Long getId();
}
----

In this example `CatView` has two attributes, `name` and `age`. Even though the interfaces aren't entity views, they could have custom mappings.

// TODO: Warn about equlas-hashCode implementations in abstract classes

=== Mapping types

So far, you have mostly seen basic attribute mappings in entity views, but there is actually support for far many mapping types.

* Basic mappings - maps basic attributes from entities into entity views
* Subview mappings - maps a *ToOne relation of an entity to an entity view
* Embeddable view mappings - maps an embeddable of an entity to an embeddable entity view
* Subquery mappings - maps the result of a subquery to a basic attribute into entity views
* Parameter mappings - maps named query parameters into an entity view
* Entity mappings - maps *ToOne or *ToMany relations of an entity as is into an entity view
* Collection mappings - maps *ToMany relations of an entity into an entity view with support for basic, subview and embeddable types
* Correlated mappings - correlates an entity type by some key and maps it or an attribute of it into an entity view as subview or basic type respectively

WARNING: In general we do not recommend to make extensive use of entity mappings as it defeats the purpose of entity views and can lead to lazy loading issues

Apart from mapping attributes, it is also possible have a constructor and map parameters when using an abstract class.
One of the biggest use cases for this is for doing further transformations on the data that can't be pushed to the DBMS like e.g. money formatting.

=== Mapping defaults

As mentioned before, the entity view module implements a convention over configuration approach and thus has some smart defaults for mappings.
Whenever an attribute(getter method) without a mapping annotation is encountered, a default mapping to the same named entity attribute will be created.
If there is none, it will obviously report an error.

[[anchor-id-mappings]]
=== Id mappings

Id mappings are currently required and declare that an attribute represents the identifier i.e. can be used to uniquely identify an entity view object.
The id mapping is declared by annotating the desired attribute with `@IdMapping` and specifying the mapping path.
Having an id attribute allows an entity view to map collections, be mapped in collections and gives an entity view object a meaningful identity.

When an id mapping is present, the generated entity view implementation's equals-hashCode implementation will be based on it.

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
interface CatView {
    @IdMapping("id")
    Long getId();
}
----

=== Basic mappings

A basic mapping is declared by annotating the desired attribute with `@Mapping` and specifying the mapping expression.
An attribute that has no mapping annotations is only considered to have a basic mapping if it is of a basic type like e.g. Integer. Without a mapping annotation, the default mapping rules apply.
In general, every non-collection and non-managed type is considered to be basic. Managed types are JPA managed types and entity view types.

Although most example only use path expressions for the mapping, it is actually allowed to use any link:{core_doc}#expressions[scalar expression] that JPQL or {projectname} allows.

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
interface CatView {
    @IdMapping("id")
    Long getId();

    @Mapping("UPPER(name)")
    String getUpperName();
}
----

As you might expect, the expression `UPPER(name)` will upper-case the name, so `getUpperName()` will return the upper-cased name.
Applying such an entity view on a simple query builder will show what happens behind the scenes.

[source,java]
----
List<CatView> result = evm.applySetting(
        EntityViewSetting.create(CatView.class),
        cbf.create(em, Cat.class)
    ).getResultList();
----

[source,sql]
----
SELECT cat.id, UPPER(cat.name)
FROM Cat cat
----

The expression in the mapping ends up as select item in the query just as expected.

=== Subview and Embeddable view mappings

Subview and embeddable view mappings are similar to basic mappings in the sense that the same rules apply, except for the allowed mappings.
Since these mappings get their data from objects of managed types, only path expressions are allowed for their mappings.
Path expressions can have arbitrary depth i.e. multiple de-references like `relation.subRelation.otherRelation` and path elements can be of the following types:

* Simple path elements that refer to entity type attributes
* `TREAT` expression like `TREAT(..).subRelation`
* Qualified expression like `KEY(..).subRelation`
* Array expression like `relation[:param].subRelation`

A subview mapping is given when the type of the attribute is a entity view type.
Since a entity view is always declared for a specific entity type, the target type of the subview mapping and the entity view's entity type must be compatible.
This means that you could apply a `AnimalView` to a `Cat` if it extends `Animal` but can't apply a `PersonView` since it's not compatible i.e. `Cat` is not a subtype of `Person`.

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Person.class)
interface PersonView {
    @IdMapping("id")
    Long getId();

    String getName();
}

@EntityView(Animal.class)
interface AnimalView {
    @IdMapping("id")
    Long getId();

    String getName();
}

@EntityView(Cat.class)
interface CatView {
    @IdMapping("id")
    Long getId();

    AnimalView getFather();
}
----

As you might imagine, the `CatView` will additionally select attributes of the father relation since they are requested by the `AnimalView`.
In order to understand the following generated query, you should know what an link:{core_doc}#implicit-joins[implicit join] does and how entity views make use of such implicit joins.

Behind the scenes, the entity views runtime will apply a select on the criteria builder for the expressions `cat.id`, `father.id` and `father.name`.
The expression `father.name` accesses an entity attribute is only accessible when actually joining the relation. This is why an implicit/default join is generated for the father relation.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT cat.id, father_1.id, father_1.name
FROM Cat cat
LEFT JOIN cat.father father_1
----

Since the `father` relation is optional or nullable, a (default) left join is created due to the rules of link:{core_doc}#model-awareness[model awareness] in implicit joins.
This is a perfect fit for entity views as the subview object will be simply `null` if a cat has no father. If the implicit join worked like JPQL defines it, an inner join would have to be created.
An inner join would mean that cats without a father would get filtered out which is an undesirable effect since we only want a projection on top of a base query.

NOTE: Subviews can in turn have subviews again, so there is no limitation on the depth. The only requirement is that there is no cycle.

A embeddable view mapping is given when the type of the attribute is a embeddable entity view type.
It's just like a subview mapping but works with JPA embeddable types. Imagine the following model for illustration purposes.

[source,java]
----
@Embeddable
class Name {
    String firstName;
    String lastName;
}

@Entity
class Person {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    Long id;
    @Embedded
    Name name;
}

@EmbeddableEntityView(Name.class)
interface SimpleNameView {
    String getFirstName();
}

@EntityView(Person.class)
interface PersonView {
    @IdMapping("id")
    Long getId();

    SimpleNameView getName();
}
----

Applying a person view would produce a query like

[source,sql]
----
SELECT person.id, person.name.firstName
FROM Person person
----

NOTE: A limitation in Hibernate actually requires the use of embeddable entity views for mapping of element collections

=== Subquery mappings

Subquery mappings allow to map scalar subqueries into entity views and are declared by annotating the desired attribute with `@MappingSubquery` and specifying a link:{entity_view_jdoc}/persistence/view/SubqueryProvider.html[`SubqueryProvider`].
The following example should illustrate the usage:

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
interface CatView {
    @IdMapping("id")
    Long getId();

    @MappingSubquery(KittenCountSubqueryProvider.class)
    Long getKittenCount();

    class KittenCountSubqueryProvider implements SubqueryProvider {

        @Override
        public <T> T createSubquery(SubqueryInitiator<T> subqueryBuilder) {
            return subqueryBuilder.from(Cat.class, "subCat")
                    .select("COUNT(*)")
                    .whereOr()
                        .where("subCat.father.id").eqExpression("OUTER(id)")
                        .where("subCat.mother.id").eqExpression("OUTER(id)")
                    .endOr()
                .end();
        }
    }
}
----

This entity view already comes into contact with the link:{core_doc}[core] API for creating subqueries.
It produces just what it defines, a subquery in the select clause.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
    cat.id,
    (
        SELECT COUNT(*)
        FROM Cat subCat
        WHERE subCat.father.id = cat.id
           OR subCat.mother.id = cat.id
    )
FROM Cat cat
----

In the subquery provider before you saw the usage of `OUTER` which is gone in the final query.
This is because `OUTER` is a way to refer to attributes of the parent query root without having to refer to the concrete the query alias.
For more information on this check out the documentation of the link:{core_doc}#outer-function[`OUTER` function]

TIP: The subquery was just used for illustration purposes and could be replaced with a basic mapping `SIZE(kittens)` which would also generate a more efficient query.

[[anchor-parameter-mappings]]
=== Parameter mappings

A parameter mapping is a convenient way to _inject_ the values of query parameters or optional parameters into instances of an entity view.
Introducing a parameter mapping with `@MappingParameter` will introduce a _fake_ select item. If a parameter is not used in a query, `NULL` will be injected into the entity view.

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
interface CatView {
    @IdMapping("id")
    Long getId();

    @MappingParameter("myParam")
    String getMyParam();
}
----

[source,sql]
----
SELECT cat.id, NULLIF(1,1)
FROM Cat cat
----

Parameter mappings are probably most useful in <<anchor-constructor-mapping,constructor mappings>> where they can be used for some transformation logic.

=== Entity mappings

Apart from having custom projections for entity or embeddable types through subviews, you can also map the JPA managed types directly.
You can use the `@Mapping` annotation if desired and map any path expression as singular or plural attribute(i.e. collection) with managed types.

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
interface CatView {
    @IdMapping("id")
    Long getId();

    Cat getFather();
}
----

[source,sql]
----
SELECT cat.id, father_1
FROM Cat cat
LEFT JOIN cat.father father_1
----

Beware that when using managed types directly, you might run into _lazy loading_ issues when accessing uninitialized/un-fetched properties of the entity.

You can however specify what properties should be fetched for such entity mappings by using the `fetches` configuration.

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
interface CatView {
    @IdMapping("id")
    Long getId();

    @Mapping(fetches = "kittens")
    Cat getFather();
}
----

This will fetch the kittens of the father.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT cat.id, father_1
FROM Cat cat
LEFT JOIN cat.father father_1
LEFT JOIN FETCH father_1.kittens kittens_1
----

=== Collection mappings

One of the most important features of the {projectname} entity view module is the possibility to map collections.
You can map collections defined in the entity model to collections in the entity view model in multiple ways.

==== Simple 1:1 collection mapping

The simplest possible mapping is a 1:1 mapping of e.g. a *ToMany collection.

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
interface CatView {
    @IdMapping("id")
    Long getId();

    Set<Cat> getKittens();
}
----

This will simply join the `kittens` collection. During entity view construction the elements are collected and the result is flattened as expected.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT cat.id, kittens_1
FROM Cat cat
LEFT JOIN cat.kittens kittens_1
----

==== Subset basic collection mapping

Most of the time, only a subset of the properties of a relation is needed. In case only a single property is required,
the use of `@Mapping` to refer to the property within a collection can be used.

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
interface CatView {
    @IdMapping("id")
    Long getId();

    @Mapping("kittens.name")
    Set<String> getKittenNames();
}
----

This will join the `kittens` collection and only select their `name`.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT cat.id, kittens_1.name
FROM Cat cat
LEFT JOIN cat.kittens kittens_1
----

==== Subview collection mapping

For the cases when multiple properties of a relation are needed, you can also use subviews.

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
interface SimpleCatView {
    @IdMapping("id")
    Long getId();

    String getName();
}

@EntityView(Cat.class)
interface CatView extends SimpleCatView {

    Set<SimpleCatView> getKittens();
}
----

Applying the `CatView` entity view will again join the `kittens` collection but this time select some more properties.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT cat.id, kittens_1.id, kittens_1.name
FROM Cat cat
LEFT JOIN cat.kittens kittens_1
----

A subview within a collection can have subviews and collections of subviews again i.e. there is no limit to nesting.

==== Collection type re-mapping

Another nice feature of {projectname} entity views is the ability to re-map a collection to a different collection type.
In the entity model one might for example choose to always use a `java.util.Set` for mapping collections,
but to be able to make use of the elements in a UI, you might require e.g. a `java.util.List`.

Although the `kittens` relation in the `Cat` entity uses a `Set`, you can map the `kittens` as `List` in the `CatView`.
As you might expect, the order of the elements will then depend on the order of the query result.

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
interface SimpleCatView {
    @IdMapping("id")
    Long getId();

    String getName();
}

@EntityView(Cat.class)
interface CatView extends SimpleCatView {

    List<SimpleCatView> getKittens();
}
----

By executing the query with a custom link:{core_doc}#anchor-order-by-clause[`ORDER BY` clause], the result order can be made deterministic.

[source,java]
----
List<CatView> result = entityViewManager.applySetting(
        EntityViewSetting.create(CatView.class),
        cb.create(Cat.class)
            .orderByAsc("name")
            .orderByAsc("kittens.name")
    ).getResultList();
----

[source,sql]
----
SELECT cat.id, kittens_1.id, kittens_1.name
FROM Cat cat
LEFT JOIN cat.kittens kittens_1
ORDER BY cat.name       ASC NULLS LAST,
         kittens_1.name ASC NULLS LAST
----

NOTE: We do not recommend to rely on this behavior but instead make use of sorted collection mappings.

==== Ordered collection mapping

Apart from changing the collection type to e.g. `List` it is also possible to get _ordered_ results with sets.
By specifying `ordered = true` for the collection via the annotation `@CollectionMapping` you can force a set implementation that retains the insertion order like a `LinkedHashSet`.

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
interface SimpleCatView {
    @IdMapping("id")
    Long getId();

    String getName();
}

@EntityView(Cat.class)
interface CatView extends SimpleCatView {

    @CollectionMapping(ordered = true)
    Set<SimpleCatView> getKittens();
}
----

The query doesn't change, the only thing that does, is the implementation for the collection.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT cat.id, kittens_1.id, kittens_1.name
FROM Cat cat
LEFT JOIN cat.kittens kittens_1
----

==== Sorted collection mapping

In addition to ordering, the following sorted collection types are supported

* `SortedSet` and `NavigableSet`
* `SortedMap` and `NavigableMap`

You can specify the comparator for the collection via the annotation `@CollectionMapping`

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
interface SimpleCatView {
    @IdMapping("id")
    Long getId();

    String getName();

    static class DefaultComparator implements Comparator<SimpleCatView> {

        @Override
        public int compare(SimpleCatView o1, SimpleCatView o2) {
            return String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER.compare(o1.getName(), o2.getName());
        }
    }
}

@EntityView(Cat.class)
interface CatView extends SimpleCatView {

    @CollectionMapping(comparator = SimpleCatView.DefaultComparator.class)
    SortedSet<SimpleCatView> getKittens();
}
----

This will ensure the correct ordering of the collection elements regardless of the query ordering.
The query stays the same.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT cat.id, kittens_1.id, kittens_1.name
FROM Cat cat
LEFT JOIN cat.kittens kittens_1
----

==== Indexed collection re-mapping

Mapping an indexed collection like a `java.util.Map` or `java.util.List` with an `@OrderColumn` can happen in multiple ways.
Let's consider the following model.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
class Cat {
    @Id
    Long id;

    @OneToMany
    @OrderColumn
    List<Cat> indexedKittens;

    @ManyToMany
    Map<Cat, Cat> kittensBestFriends;
}

@EntityView(Cat.class)
interface SimpleCatView {
    @IdMapping("id")
    Long getId();

    String getName();
}
----

Indexed mapping::
One way is to map the collections indexed again, i.e. a `Map` in the entity is mapped as `Map` in the entity view.

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
interface CatView extends SimpleCatView {

    List<SimpleCatView> getIndexedKittens();

    Map<SimpleCatView, SimpleCatView> getKittensBestFriends(); # <1>
}
----
<1> Careful when mapping the key to a subview. This is only supported in the latest JPA provider versions

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
    cat.id,

    INDEX(indexedKittens_1),
    indexedKittens_1.id,
    indexedKittens_1.name

    KEY(kittensBestFriends_1).id,
    KEY(kittensBestFriends_1).name,

    kittensBestFriends_1.id,
    kittensBestFriends_1.name
FROM Cat cat
LEFT JOIN cat.indexedKittens indexedKittens_1
LEFT JOIN cat.kittensBestFriends kittensBestFriends_1
----

Map-Key only mapping::
By using the qualified expression `KEY()` you can map the keys of a map to a collection by using `@Mapping`

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
interface CatView extends SimpleCatView {

    @Mapping("KEY(kittensBestFriends)")
    List<SimpleCatView> getKittens();
}
----

[source,sql]
----
SELECT cat.id, KEY(kittensBestFriends_1).id, KEY(kittensBestFriends_1).name
FROM Cat cat
LEFT JOIN cat.kittensBestFriends kittensBestFriends_1
----

Map-Value only mapping::
Simply mapping a path expression for a `Map` to a normal collection, will result in only fetching the map values.

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
interface CatView extends SimpleCatView {

    @Mapping("kittensBestFriends")
    List<SimpleCatView> getBestFriends();
}
----

[source,sql]
----
SELECT cat.id, kittensBestFriends_1.id, kittensBestFriends_1.name
FROM Cat cat
LEFT JOIN cat.kittensBestFriends kittensBestFriends_1
----

List-Value only mapping::
Sometimes it might be required to ignore the index of an indexed `List` when mapping it to a `List` again. To do so use `ignoreIndex` on `@CollectionMapping`

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
interface CatView extends SimpleCatView {

    @Mapping("indexedKittens")
    @CollectionMapping(ignoreIndex = true)
    List<SimpleCatView> getKittens();
}
----

[source,sql]
----
SELECT cat.id, indexedKittens_1.id, indexedKittens_1.name
FROM Cat cat
LEFT JOIN cat.indexedKittens indexedKittens_1
----

=== Singular collection type mappings

There are cases when the entity model defines a collection that is actually a singular entity attribute. This can happen when you use custom type implementations or JPA 2.1 attribute converters that produce collections.
A custom type or converter could map a DBMS array, json, xml or any other type to a collection. Since such an entity attribute is not a relation, it can only be a singular attribute.
By default {projectname} entity views assume that an entity view attribute with a collection type is a plural attribute and the mapping refers to a plural entity attribute.
In order to be able to map such special singular attribute collections, you have to specifically use `@MappingSingular`.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
class Cat {

    @Id
    Long id;

    @Basic
    @Convert(converter = StringSetConverter.class)
    Set<String> tags;
}

class StringSetConverter implements AttributeConverter<String, Set<String>> { ... }

@EntityView(Cat.class)
interface CatView {

    @IdMapping("id")
    Long getId();

    @MappingSingular
    Set<String> getTags();
}
----

Beware that you can't re-map the collection type in this case although this might soon be possible. Also see https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/issues/361[#361] for further information.

The query will not generate a join but simply select the `tags` since it's a singular attribute.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT cat.id, cat.tags
FROM Cat cat
----

[[anchor-correlation-mappings]]
=== Correlated mappings

In some entity models, not every relation between entities might be explicitly mapped. There are multiple possible reasons for that like e.g. not wanting to have explicit dependencies, to keep it simple etc.
Apart from unmapped relations, there is sometimes the need to _correlate_ entities based on some criteria with other entities which are more of an ad-hoc nature than explicit relations.

For these cases {projectname} entity views introduces the concept of _correlated mappings_. These mappings can be used to connect entities through a custom criteria instead of through mapped entity relations.
Correlated mappings can be used for any attribute type(basic, entity, subview, collection) although singular basic attributes can also be implemented as <<Subquery mappings,normal subqueries>>.

A correlation mapping is declared by annotating the desired attribute with `@MappingCorrelated` or `@MappingCorrelatedSimple`.

==== General correlated mappings

In order to map the correlation you need to specify some values

* `correlationBasis` - An expression that maps to the so called _correlation key_
* `correlator` - The `CorrelationProvider` to use for the correlation that introduces a so called _correlated entity_

By default, the correlated entity type is _projected into_ the view. To map a specific property of the entity type, use the `correlationResult` attribute.
There is also the possibility to specify a <<anchor-fetch-strategies,_fetch strategy_>> that should be used for the correlation. By default, the `SELECT` strategy is used.

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
public interface CatView {

    @IdMapping("id")
    Long getId();

    @MappingCorrelated(
        correlationBasis = "age",
        correlator = PersonAgeCorrelationProvider.class,
        fetch = FetchStrategy.JOIN
    )
    Set<Person> getSameAgedPersons();

    static class PersonAgeCorrelationProvider implements CorrelationProvider {

        @Override
        public void applyCorrelation(CorrelationBuilder builder, String correlationExpression) {
            final String alias = builder.getCorrelationAlias();  # <1>
            builder.correlate(Person.class)
                .on(alias + ".age").inExpressions(correlationExpression) # <2>
            .end();
        }

    }
}
----
<1> `getCorrelationAlias()` defines the alias for the correlated entity
<2> `correlationExpression` represents the `correlationBasis`. We generally recommend to use the `IN` predicate through `inExpressions()` to be able to easily switch the fetch strategy

Depending on the fetch strategy multiple other queries might be executed. Check out the different <<anchor-fetch-strategies,fetch strategies>> for further information.
In this case, the `JOIN` strategy was used, so the following query is generated.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT cat.id, pers
FROM Cat cat
LEFT JOIN Person correlated_SameAgedPersons # <1>
       ON cat.age = correlated_SameAgedPersons.age # <2>
----
<1> This makes use of the so called link:{core_doc}#anchor-entity-joins[`entity join` feature] which is only available in newer JPA provider versions
<2> Note that the `IN` predicate which was used in the correlation provider was rewritten to a equality predicate

Since entity joins are required for using the `JOIN` fetch strategy with correlation mappings you have to make sure your JPA provider supports them.
If your JPA provider does not support entity joins, you have to use a different fetch strategy instead.

NOTE: Entity joins are only supported in newer versions of JPA providers(Hibernate 5.1+, EclipseLink 2.4+, DataNucleus 5+)

WARNING: Until https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/issues/341[#341] is fixed, you should make sure that when using relations as correlation keys, if it wouldn't be better to use the relations id instead or vice versa.
For some providers it might even be *necessary* to use the plain relation `relation` instead of it's id `relation.id` or the other way round because of possible cyclic join dependencies.
The possible cyclic joins might happen for a JPA provider because it might generate a join for an expression like `relation.id` whereas other JPA providers might not.

==== Simple correlated mappings

Since correlation providers are mostly static, {projectname} also offers a way to define simple correlations in a declarative manner.
The `@MappingCorrelatedSimple` annotation only requires a few values

* `correlationBasis` - An expression that maps to the so called _correlation key_
* `correlated` - The _correlated entity_ type
* `correlationExpression` - The expression to use for correlating the _correlated entity_ type to the view

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Person.class)
public interface PersonView {

    @IdMapping("id")
    Long getId();

    String getName();
}

@EntityView(Cat.class)
public interface CatView {

    @IdMapping("id")
    Long getId();

    @MappingCorrelated(
        correlationBasis = "age",
        correlated = Person.class,
        correlationExpression = "age IN correlationKey" # <1>
        fetch = FetchStrategy.JOIN
    )
    Set<PersonView> getSameAgedPersons(); # <2>
}
----
<1> The expression uses the default name for the correlation key but could use a different name by specifying the attribute `correlationKeyAlias`
<2> As you see here, it is obviously also possible to map subviews for correlated entity types

Just like the general correlation, by default, the correlated entity type is _projected into_ the view. To map a specific property of the entity type, use the `correlationResult` attribute.
There is also the possibility to specify a <<anchor-fetch-strategies,_fetch strategy_>> that should be used for the correlation. By default, the `SELECT` strategy is used.

=== Mapping expression extensions

{projectname} entity views generally supports the full set of link:{core_doc}#expressions[expressions] that JPQL and {projectname} core module supports,
but in addition to that, also offers some expression extensions.

==== OUTER

In {projectname} core the `OUTER` function can be used to refer to the query root of a parent query from within a subquery.
This is still the same with {projectname} entity views but might lead to unintuitive behavior when the subquery provider uses `OUTER` and is used in a subview.
The following example shows the unintuitive behavior.

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
interface CatView {

    @IdMapping("id")
    Long getId();

    Set<KittenCatView> getKittens();
}

@EntityView(Cat.class)
interface KittenCatView {

    @IdMapping("id")
    Long getId();

    @MappingSubquery(KittenCountSubqueryProvider.class)
    Long getKittenCount();

    class KittenCountSubqueryProvider implements SubqueryProvider {

        @Override
        public <T> T createSubquery(SubqueryInitiator<T> subqueryBuilder) {
            return subqueryBuilder.from(Cat.class, "subCat")
                    .select("COUNT(*)")
                    .whereOr()
                        .where("subCat.father.id").eqExpression("OUTER(id)")
                        .where("subCat.mother.id").eqExpression("OUTER(id)")
                    .endOr()
                .end();
        }
    }
}
----

When applying the `KittenCatView` directly, everything works as expected.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
    cat.id,
    (
        SELECT COUNT(*)
        FROM Cat subCat
        WHERE subCat.father.id = cat.id
        OR subCat.mother.id = cat.id
    )
FROM Cat cat
----

But when using `KittenCatView` as subview within `CatView`, it starts to break.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
    cat.id,
    kittens_1.id,
    (
        SELECT COUNT(*)
        FROM Cat subCat
        WHERE subCat.father.id = cat.id # <1>
           OR subCat.mother.id = cat.id
    )
FROM Cat cat
LEFT JOIN cat.kittens kittens_1
----
<1> `OUTER` resolved to `cat` instead of `kittens_1`

Unfortunately this is how it works right now. The `OUTER` function doesn't know about the entity view structure and will refer to the *query root* for now.

In the future, the semantics of `OUTER` will be changed to be able to refer to the _embedding entity view_. Also see https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/issues/367[#367] for more information on this.

==== VIEW_ROOT

The `VIEW_ROOT` function can be used to refer to the relation for which the main entity view is applied.
Normally this will resolve to the query root, but beware that the entity view root might not always be the query root.
One of the main use cases for this function is when using <<anchor-correlation-mappings,correlated subview mappings>>.

NOTE: For further information on applying a different entity view root take a look into the <<anchor-entity-view-apply-root,querying chapter>>.

The `VIEW_ROOT` function can be used in a correlation provider to additionally refer to a view root.

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
public interface CatView {

    @IdMapping("id")
    Long getId();

    @MappingCorrelated(
        correlationBasis = "age",
        correlator = CatAgeCorrelationProvider.class
    )
    Set<Cat> getSameAgedCats();

    static class CatAgeCorrelationProvider implements CorrelationProvider {

        @Override
        public void applyCorrelation(CorrelationBuilder builder, String correlationExpression) {
            final String correlatedCat = builder.getCorrelationAlias();
            builder.correlate(Cat.class)
                .on(correlatedCat + ".age").inExpressions(correlationExpression)
                .on(correlatedCat + ".id").notInExpressions("VIEW_ROOT(id)") # <1>
            .end();
        }

    }
}
----
<1> We generally recommend to use the `IN` predicate through `inExpressions()` or `notInExpressions()` to be able to easily switch the fetch strategy

The `VIEW_ROOT` function is usable with every fetch strategy. In case of the `JOIN` fetch strategy the result is just as expected.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT cat.id, correlatedCat
FROM Cat cat
LEFT JOIN Cat correlatedCat
       ON correlatedCat.age = cat.age
      AND correlatedCat.id <> cat.id # <1>
----
<1> Again, the `IN` predicate was rewritten to an equality predicate

TIP: Make sure you understand the <<anchor-select-fetch-strategy-view-root,implication> of the `VIEW_ROOT` function when using the batched `SELECT` fetch strategy as this might affect performance.

[[anchor-constructor-mapping]]
=== Entity View constructor mapping

So far, all mapping examples used interfaces for entity views, but as outlined in the beginning, {projectname} entity views also has support for abstract classes.
There are multiple use cases for using abstract classes for entity views, but in general we recommend to use an interface as often as possible.
The biggest advantage of using abstract classes is that you can have a custom constructor which can further apply transformations on data.

==== Map external data model with view constructor

One of those use cases for a view constructor is integrating with an existing external data model.

[source,java]
----
class CatRestDTO {
    private final Long id;
    private final String name;

    public MyOldCatDTO(Long id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }

    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}
----

In general we recommend to use the entity view types directly instead of an external data model, because of the additional boilerplate code needed.
Note that the creators of {projectname} are not generally against external data models since it is reasonable to have them e.g. in API projects that shouldn't expose a library dependency.

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
public abstract class CatView extends CatRestDTO {

    public CatView(
        @Mapping("id") Long id,
        @Mapping("name") String name
    ) {
        super(id, name);
    }

    // @JsonIgnore # <1>
    @IdMapping("id")
    public abstract Long getInternalId();

}
----
<1> Ignore the id attribute mapping that is unfortunately necessary for now

Now you can use the `CatView` for efficient querying but still have objects that are an instance of `CatRestDTO` and can thus be used like normal `CatRestDTO` instances.
To decouple the actual entity view `CatView` from the data access or service one normally uses method signatures like

[source,java]
----
interface CatDAO {
    <T> List<T> findAll(Class<T> entityViewClass); # <1>

    <T> List<T> findAll(EntityViewSetting<T, CriteriaBuilder<T>> entityViewSetting); # <2>
}
----
<1> Create the `EntityViewSetting` within the implementation
<2> Supply a custom `EntityViewSetting` which can also have filters, sorts, optional parameters and pagination information

By using one of these approaches you can have a projection independent implementation for `CatDAO` and let the consumer i.e. a REST endpoint decide about the representation.

==== Additional data transformation in view constructor

Another use case for view constructors is the transformation of data. Sometimes it is just easier to do the transformation in Java code instead of through a JPQL expression,
but then there are also times when there is no other way than doing it in Java code.

Let's assume you want to have an attribute that contains different text based on the age.

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
interface CatView {

    @IdMapping("id")
    Long getId();

    @Mapping("CASE WHEN age = 0 THEN 'newborn' WHEN age < 10 THEN 'child' WHEN age < 18 THEN 'teenager' ELSE 'adult' END")
    String getText();

}
----

As you can see, the `CASE WHEN` expression can be used to implement that, but if the text is only static, there is no need to use that kind of expression.
You can instead just inject the `age` as constructor parameter and do the mapping to the text in Java code.

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
public abstract class CatView {

    private final String text;

    public CatView(@Mapping("age") long age) {
        if (age == 0) {
            this.text = "newborn";
        } else if (age < 10) {
            this.text = "child";
        } else if (age < 18) {
            this.text = "teenager";
        } else {
            this.text = "adult";
        }
    }

    @IdMapping("id")
    public abstract Long getId();

    public String getText() {
        return text;
    }
}
----

Since that kind of mapping logic is normally externalized, {projectname} entity views also offers a way to _inject_ external services.
You can provide services to entity views via <<anchor-optional-parameters,_optional parameters_>> like


[source,java]
----
EntityViewSetting<CatView, CriteriaBuilder<CatView>> setting
    = EntityViewSetting.create(CatView.class);

setting.addOptionalParameter("ageMapper", new AgeToTextMapper());
List<CatView> result = entityViewManager.applySetting(setting, cbf.create(em, Cat.class))
    .getResultList();
----

The services, or optional parameters in general can be consumed either as attributes or as constructor parameters with `@MappingParameter`.
If the parameter is not supplied, `null` is injected.

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
public abstract class CatView {

    private final String text;

    public CatView(
        @Mapping("age") long age,
        @MappingParameter("ageMapper") AgeToTextMapper mapper
    ) {
        this.text = ageMapper.map(age);
    }

    @IdMapping("id")
    public abstract Long getId();

    public String getText() {
        return text;
    }
}
----

[[anchor-named-constructor]]
==== Multiple named constructors

So far, the example always used no or just a single constructor, but it is actually possible to have multiple constructors.
Every constructor in an entity view must have a name defined via `@ViewConstructor`. The default name is the empty string `""`.

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
public abstract class CatView {

    private final String text;

    public CatView(
        @Mapping("age") long age,
        @MappingParameter("ageMapper") AgeToTextMapper mapper
    ) {
        this.text = ageMapper.map(age);
    }

    @ViewConstructor("special")
    public CatView(@Mapping("age") long age) {
        this.text = age > 80 ? "oldy" : "normal";
    }

    @IdMapping("id")
    public abstract Long getId();

    public String getText() {
        return text;
    }
}
----

The constructor name can be chosen when constructing a `EntityViewSetting` via link:{entity_view_jdoc}/persistence/view/EntityViewSetting.html#create(java.lang.Class,%20java.lang.String)[`create()`].

[source,java]
----
EntityViewSetting.create(CatView.class, "special");
----

==== Using attribute getters in constructor

Since mapping constructor parameters can become very cumbersome and oftentimes you need a value not only in the constructor but also accessible directly via a getter,
{projectname} came up with a solution that allows you to use the getters of attributes in the constructor.

It might not be immediately obvious why this is a special thing. Since entity views are declared as abstract classes you can imagine that the runtime has to actually create concrete classes.
These concrete classes _normally_ initialize fields *after* calling the super constructor, thus making it impossible for the super constructor to actually retrieve values by using the attribute getters.
The JVM enforces that fields can only be accessed after the super constructor has been called, so normally there is no way that the getter implementations that serve the fields can return non-null values in the super constructor.
Fortunately, {projectname} entity views found a way around this limitation of the JVM by making use of the infamous `sun.misc.Unsafe` to define a class that would normally fail bytecode verification.
The trick is, that the implementations that are generated will set the fields before calling the super constructor thus making the values available to the super constructor.

By default, all abstract classes will be defined through `sun.misc.Unsafe`.
If you don't want that behavior and instead want bytecode verifiable implementations to be generated, you can always disable this strategy by using a <<proxy-unsafe-allowed,configuration property>>.

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
public abstract class CatView {

    private final String text;

    public CatView(@MappingParameter("ageMapper") AgeToTextMapper mapper) {
        this.text = ageMapper.map(getAge()); # <1>
    }

    @IdMapping("id")
    public abstract Long getId();

    public abstract Long getAge();

    public String getText() {
        return text;
    }
}
----
<1> If the unsafe proxy is used, `getAge()` will return the actual value, otherwise will return `null`
