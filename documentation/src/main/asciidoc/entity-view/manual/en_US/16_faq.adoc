== FAQ

This section tries to cover some standard questions that often come up when introducing entity views or updatable entity views into a project
as well as some common problems with explanations and possible solutions.

=== Why do I get an optimistic lock exception when updating an updatable entity view?

The `com.blazebit.persistence.view.OptimisticLockException` is very similar to the `javax.persistence.OptimisticLockException` and when thrown,
it signals that an update isn't possible because of a change of an object that happened in the meantime. This can also happen when you do not use optimistic locking explicitly.

==== If you try to update a non-existent entity

When trying to update an entity that does not exist, the `EntityViewManager.update` operation will throw the `com.blazebit.persistence.view.OptimisticLockException`.

* The entity could have been deleted in the meantime i.e. between loading the view and the update operation
* The entity view causing the exception is the result of a wrong usage of `EntityViewManager.convert` as it is missing the `ConvertOption.CREATE_NEW`

==== If you try to update a concurrently updated entity

Either the entity was updated within the current transaction or within another transaction through a different mechanism or a different entity view object.
If an update in a different transaction caused the exception, it is necessary to load the new version of the entity view and let the end-user enter the values to update again.
By inspecting the change model of the old instance one can assist the user by copying over non-conflicting value changes and just highlight conflicting changes.

If a previous update in the same transaction causes the exception, the code should be adapted to prevent this from happening or updating the version on the entity view accordingly.

=== Why do I get a "could not invoke proxy constructor" exception when fetching entity views?

Entity views are type checked for most parts, but there are some dynamic non-declarative parts that can't be type checked that might cause this runtime exception when using a wrong result.
Usually, this happens when a `SubqueryProvider` or `CorrelationProvider` is in use. The implementations of these classes define the result type in a manner that is not type checkable.

If a `SubqueryProvider` returns an integer via e.g. `select("1")` or `select("someIntAttribute")`, but the entity view attribute using the subquery provider uses a different type like e.g. `boolean`,
constructing an instance of that entity view might fail when trying to interpret the integer as boolean with an `IllegalArgumentException` saying that types are incompatible.
The obvious fix is to correct either the select item to return the correct type or the entity view attribute to declare the appropriate attribute type.
In case of a subquery provider it is also possible to wrap the subquery into a more complex expression by using e.g. `@MappingSubquery(value = MyProvider.class, subqueryAlias = "subquery", expression = "CASE WHEN EXISTS subquery THEN true ELSE false END")`.

A `CorrelationProvider` can fail in a similar manner as it defines the entity type it correlates via `correlate(SomeEntity.class)`.
If the entity view attribute expects a different type that is not compatible, it will fail at runtime with an `IllegalArgumentException` saying that types are incompatible.
If a correlation result is defined via `@MappingCorrelated(correlationResult = "someAttributeOfCorrelatedEntity")` the type of that expression must be compatible which can be another cause for an error.
This problem can be fixed by adapting the correlation result expression, by changing the correlated entity in the correlation provider or by changing the declared attribute type.
