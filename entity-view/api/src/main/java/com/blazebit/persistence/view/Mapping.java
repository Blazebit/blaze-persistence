/**
 * A mapping to a JPQL expression which contains references to fields of the entity.
 * The {@linkplain Mapping} annotation can be applied to abstract getter methods of an interface or abstract class. It may also be applied to constructor parameters.
 *
 * The use of the {@linkplain Mapping} annotation is optional for getter methods. If the {@linkplain Mapping} annotation is not
 * specified for such a getter, the default values of the {@linkplain Mapping} annotation will apply. This means that getter
 * methods are automatically mapped to their attribute names.
 *
 * <code>
 * Example 1:
 *
 * public String getName();
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * {@literal @}Mapping("UPPER(name)")
 * public String getUpperName();
 *
 * </code>
 *
 * Example 1 shows a getter which is implicitly mapped to the attribute name which in this case is "name".
 * Example 2 shows that a mapping can contain arbitrary JPQL expressions.
