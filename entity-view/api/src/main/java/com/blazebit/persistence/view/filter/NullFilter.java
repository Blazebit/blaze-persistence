 * A placeholder for a filter implementation that implements a is null and is not null filter.

 * A null filter accepts an object. The {@linkplain Object#toString()} representation of that object will be parsed to a boolean
 * if the object is not instance of {@linkplain Boolean}.
 * If the resulting boolean is true, the filter will apply an is null restriction, otherwise an is not null restriction.
