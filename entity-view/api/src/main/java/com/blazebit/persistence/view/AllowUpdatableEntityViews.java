/**
 * Specifies that the annotated attribute is allowed to use an updatable entity view type even if it is an owned *ToOne relation.
 *
 * By default, it is disallowed to use an updatable entity view type for owned *ToOne relationships because it is rarely necessary and often results in more problems than it solves.
 * It is vital for a user to understand the implications of allowing updatable entity view types for such relationships.
 *
 * Updatable entity views only allow to model updates of tree-like structures, but not graphs.
 * It is currently a technical limitation because dirty tracking currently only works with a single parent object,
 * but it is also believed that in a domain driven approach, with proper bounded contexts, it is not needed.
 *
 * The technical limitation manifests itself at runtime, when it encounters a graph like updatable object structure.
 * When loading an updatable entity view that contains an owned *ToOne relationship, it is possible for two different root objects to refer to the same sub-object via the *ToOne relationship.
 * If the entity view type used for the *ToOne relationship is updatable, it could end up having multiple parent objects, which currently isn't allowed and results in an exception.
 *
 * There may be reasons to why the entity model was done this way, but at runtime, the objects conform to a tree-like structure.
 * There are a few cases that are safe. If the relationship is reached from the query root via OneToOne relationships,
 * or the owners of the ManyToOne relationships are guaranteed to have distinct objects, allowing updatable entity view types is safe.
 *
 * At some point, the underlying technical limitation will be removed, yet it will probably not be allowed by default to use updatable entity view types for owned *ToOne relationships.
