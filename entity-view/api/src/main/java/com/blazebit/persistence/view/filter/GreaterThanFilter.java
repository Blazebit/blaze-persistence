/**
 * A placeholder for a filter implementation that implements a greater than filter.
 * This placeholder can be used in a {@link AttributeFilter} annotation.
 *
 * A greater than filter accepts a class and an object. The class is interpreted as the expected type. This is used to convert the
 * object parameter. The following conversion are done based on the expected type in the right order.
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>If the value is a {@link SubqueryProvider}, the filter will create a subquery restriction.</li>
 * <li>If the value is an instance of the expected type, the value will be used in the restriction as is.</li>
 * <li>If the parsing of the {@linkplain Object#toString()} representation of the object to the expected type is successful,
 * the parsed value will be used in the restriction.</li>
 * <li>If the parsing of the object fails, an {@link IllegalArgumentException} is thrown.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param <FilterValue> The type of the filter value i.e. the attribute type
